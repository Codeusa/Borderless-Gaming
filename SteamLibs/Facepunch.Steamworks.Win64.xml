            This is needed because the exception isn't always accessible when running

             if there is no NAT-traversal accomplished or there is a recognized adjustment

             and the connection must be routed through the Steam Datagram Relay network.

             if two hosts are in the same building or otherwise have nearly identical

             object for both of them.

             send it over the wire, or persist it in a file or database!  If you need

             Estimate the round-trip latency between two arbitrary locations, in
             milliseconds.  This is a conservative estimate, based on routing through
             the relay network.  For most basic relayed connections, this ping time
             will be pretty accurate, since it will be based on the route likely to
             be actually used.
            
             If a direct IP route is used (perhaps via NAT traversal), then the route
             will be different, and the ping time might be better.  Or it might actually
             be a bit worse!  Standard IP routing is frequently suboptimal!
            
             But even in this case, the estimate obtained using this method is a
             reasonable upper bound on the ping time.  (Also it has the advantage
             of returning immediately and not sending any packets.)
            
             In a few cases we might not able to estimate the route.  In this case
             a negative value is returned.  k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Failed means
             the reason was because of some networking difficulty.  (Failure to
             ping, etc)  k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Unknown is returned if we cannot
             currently answer the question for some other reason.
            
             Do you need to be able to do this from a backend/matchmaking server?

        <member name="M:Steamworks.SteamNetworkingUtils.InitRelayNetworkAccess">
             <summary>
             If you know that you are going to be using the relay network (for example,
             because you anticipate making P2P connections), call this to initialize the
             relay network.  If you do not call this, the initialization will
             be delayed until the first time you use a feature that requires access
             to the relay network, which will delay that first access.
            
             You can also call this to force a retry if the previous attempt has failed.
             Performing any action that requires access to the relay network will also
             trigger a retry, and so calling this function is never strictly necessary,
             but it can be useful to call it a program launch time, if access to the
             relay network is anticipated.
            
             Use GetRelayNetworkStatus or listen for SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t
             callbacks to know when initialization has completed.
             Typically initialization completes in a few seconds.
            
             Note: dedicated servers hosted in known data centers do *not* need
             to call this, since they do not make routing decisions.  However, if
             the dedicated server will be using P2P functionality, it will act as
             a "client" and this should be called.

             you call this very soon after startup the data may not be available yet.
            
             This always return the most up-to-date information we have available

            This should be called once per frame, and at worst no more than four times a second to keep the microphone input delay as low as

            As long as the in-game browser accepts and handles session cookies, Steam microtransaction checkout pages will automatically recognize the user instead of presenting a login page.
            NOTE: The URL has a very short lifetime to prevent history-snooping attacks, so you should only call this API when you are about to launch the browser, or else immediately navigate to the result URL using a hidden browser window.
            NOTE: The resulting authorization cookie has an expiration time of one day, so it would be a good idea to request and visit a new auth URL every 12 hours.

            If this fails then nothing is sent to the server. It's advisable to keep trying until the call is successful.
            This call can be rate limited. Call frequency should be on the order of minutes, rather than seconds.You should only be calling this during major state changes such as the end of a round, the map changing, or the user leaving a server. This call is required to display the achievement unlock notification dialog though, so if you have called SetAchievement then it's advisable to call this soon after that.
            If you have stats or achievements that you have saved locally but haven't uploaded with this function when your application process ends then this function will automatically be called.
            You can find additional debug information written to the %steam_install%\logs\stats_log.txt file.

             <summary>
             Normally this call is unneeded if your game has a constantly running frame loop that calls the 
             D3D Present API, or OGL SwapBuffers API every frame.
            
             However, if you have a game that only refreshes the screen on an event driven basis then that can break 
             the overlay, as it uses your Present/SwapBuffers calls to drive it's internal frame loop and it may also
             need to Present() to the screen any time an even needing a notification happens or when the overlay is
             brought up over the game by a user.  You can use this API to ask the overlay if it currently need a present
             in that case, and then you can check for this periodically (roughly 33hz is desirable) and make sure you
             refresh the screen with Present or SwapBuffers to allow the overlay to do it's work.

            <summary>
            Serialized result sets contain a short signature which can't be forged or replayed across different game sessions.
            A result set can be serialized on the local client, transmitted to other players via your game networking, and 
            deserialized by the remote players.This is a secure way of preventing hackers from lying about posessing 
            rare/high-value items. Serializes a result set with signature bytes to an output buffer.The size of a serialized 
            result depends on the number items which are being serialized.When securely transmitting items to other players, 
            it is recommended to use GetItemsByID first to create a minimal result set.
            Results have a built-in timestamp which will be considered "expired" after an hour has elapsed.See DeserializeResult
            for expiration handling.

            If you pass MASTERSERVERUPDATERPORT_USEGAMESOCKETSHARE into usQueryPort, then it causes the game server API to use 
            "GameSocketShare" mode, which means that the game is responsible for sending and receiving UDP packets for the master
            server updater.
